Custom Submission Forms are used when you want to present a custom look and feel to the user when they submit an entry.  You can add a form with many required or optional fields depending on the Entry Type of the submission.

## 1. Create a Custom Form to be used

### 1.1 Create Needed Attributes

Before a form can be designed, any needed required or custom attributes should be added.  To do this: 
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
        a. Navigate to <b>Admin Tools</b> if you are not already there (click on your username in the upper-right, then Admin Tools) 
   <br> b. Select <b>Data Management &rarr; Attributes</b>
   <br> c. Click <b>+Add New Type</b> and fill out the form as required for all attributes (required and optional) you will need to build your custom entry form in the next step.
