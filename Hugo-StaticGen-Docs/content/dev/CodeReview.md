Check that those were apply. (Obvious quick scan)

3. Check vs Coding Standards (Front-end and Server)

4. Check UI vs Style Guide

5. Check for know business rule breaks

6. Make sure any require documentation changes are made 
(It may NOT be all require documentation need for final release; just the documentation related to the ticket)

7. Move ticket as ready for testing or back to fix for adjustments.
