# Open Storefront Documentation

The Open Storefront application is a software cataloging system that is used to catalog components of interest to the DI2E community. Components include Government off the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and Open Source software (OSS). The component evaluations done by DI2E's Centers of Excellence are displayed in the Storefront and give details on the following:

-  Ownership

-  Where/How to access the software

-  Software vitals

-  Conformance

-  Links to documentation, source code and other artifacts

-  Evaluation information
