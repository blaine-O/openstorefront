* QID: 1
* Section: Discoverable
* Question: How do you expect developers to find your asset? Please list the search terms you would expect a developer to use, and provide links to any associated public descriptions of the asset
* Objective: Developers will generally leverage a search engine or a well-known registry to find things they are interested in. Typing some terms associated with the asset's functionality into a popular search engine should get "hits" on the asset within the first few pages of results. The idea here is to think about how a developer would look for an asset if they didn't know the asset existed or the name of the asset. 
* Score Criteria: 
    * Links to the entry repository or homepage show up on page 1-3 of Google search results using key terms (list the key terms used) +1
    * The entry description is accessible via the Internet +1
    * Entry description is complete +1
    * The entry description is current and updated regularly +1
    * The entry description does NOT require login to access +1
    
    Add the numbers to the right of each item above to get the score. The minimum score is 1.
