# Guide to Publishing Evaluations (Librarian)

## Overview

This guide goes over the different types of publishing and the various scenarios a librarian may run into when publishing an entry/evaluation.

Different types of publishing:

1. Entry publishing - publishes the entry summary only
2. Partial publishing - publishes all default public fields except for those that have been marked as private.
3. Full publishing - publishes all default public fields.

**Reminder:** an entry is a single entity that can have one to many evaluations.  An evaluation 
can include multiple sections, a checklist summary, recommendations, and questions.  An entry can have a description, contacts, media, resources, tags, 
relationships, and dependencies

## Who is this for?

This guide is for anyone with the role of librarian or administrator.  If unsure of current role(s), contact an administrator.

## Resolving Conflicts

A librarian may run into a conflict between multiple evaluators evaluating the same entry.  To resolve this type of conflict use the change history tool to help determine the desired content.

If the conflict is related to the entry, view the entry's history by doing the following:

1. Go to **Entries** under **Data Management** 
2. Select the entry and click on the **Edit** button
3. On the entry form, click on the **Change History** button

If the conflict is related to the evaluation, view the evaluation's history by doing the following:

1. Go to **Evaluations** under **Evaluation Management**
2. Select the evaluation and click on the **Edit** button
3. On the evaluation form, click on the **Change History** button.

Another conflict the librarian may run into is multiple change requests.  To resolve conflicts between change requests use the entry change request tool to edit and approve changes.
