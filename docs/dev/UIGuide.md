#User Interface Guide

##General Items
1. Remember this is a guide there can be variations as appropriate to the feature.  Focus on the usability and having a clear workflow.
2. Dialog bodies should be padded 10px
3. Use toolbars for actions and enable/disable buttons to guide the user to valid actions.
4. Add text to icons on button so it's very clear as to what they are.  (Where possible)
5. Form action should be left to right with the Action on right and the anti-action on the left.  English is left to right.  Action should be common choise and the anti-action the uncommon.
6. Most windows should be resizeable so they should adjust their layout accordingly.   Make sure window adjust to smaller screen sizes.  Use the percentages where appropriate but remember IE 9 can have issues.  Making the window maximizable can resolve the issues.
7. Client should handle data rendering in most cases.
8. CSS should all be kept in the dynamic CSS file for branding.  However, page/feature specific styling can be appropriate especially if it's layout related specific to the page.
9. Use the appropriate font-awesome icons for the action. See other pages.
