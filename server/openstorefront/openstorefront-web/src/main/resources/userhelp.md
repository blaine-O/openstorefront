and give details on the following:

-   Ownership
-   Where/How to access the software
-   Software vitals
-   Conformance
-   Links to documentation, source code, and other artifacts
-   Evaluation information
The application can also be used as a general cataloging system.

# 2.  User Features
------

The features that are available to users to be able to access the information in a variety of ways.

##   2.1  Searching
------

Application Search provides a way to find entry lists and articles
matching search criteria. Several types of searches are supported. The
types of searches that can be performed are:

 1.  Searching the Help file
 2.  Searching across multiple fields (entry name and description,
    tags, attribute types, codes, and descriptions)
 3.  Wildcard searching (\* and ?)
 4.  Exact phrase searching
 5.  Case insensitivity
 6.  Filtered Searches
 7.  Tags
 8.  Comparing
 9.  Customizing the display

**Note:** The type ahead on the search field only looks at the title to see if it contains the text.  
The user can then select the suggestion by clicking on it or continue with a full text search.

### 2.1.1 Searching the Help file
-------

A simple (exact text) search is provided in the help file by typing in the Search box in the 
upper-left of the help file, above the tree structure.  

### 2.1.2 Search Field Differentiation or Specificity
-------

Currently, there is no differentiation among entry Name, entry
Description, Tags, or Attributes as to the preference, specificity, or
coverage of the search. A search term or phrase is searched via a single
search box, and applied across all fields equally. For a more specific search
please see the Advanced Search under Search Tools in the help file.

### 2.1.3 Fuzzy Matching and Wildcards
------

Fuzzy matching is defined as the ability to perform inexact matches on
terms in the search index. For example, this could be used to find all
variations of prefixed or suffixed words and multiple spellings of a
word.

Fuzzy matching is done with the * and the ? characters acting as
wildcards. It is also known as wildcard searching. The * character
represents a string of letters, whereas the ? acts as a placeholder for
only a single character. The process works as shown in the queries
below:

Query: ```offi*``` Matches office, officer, official, and so on

Query: ```off*r``` Matches offer, officer, officiator, and so on

Query: ```off?r``` Matches offer, but not officer

### 2.1.4 Phrase Searches and Exact Searches
------

Exact searches must be enclosed by double quotes.

Search example: ```"create a common framework"```
Search example: ```"Air Force"``` or ```"Company Name Inc."```

Wildcards are only meant to work on individual search terms, not on
phrase searches/exact searches, as demonstrated by this example:

Works: ```eng?neering``` _(wildcard properly used)_
Does not work: ```"eng?neering b?ckground"``` _(quotes are treated as a literal string not a wildcard)_

In the second example, the search would only return results that had the
? character exactly in their respective places instead of
accepting any character in those locations as the user intended.

### 2.1.5 Case Insensitivity
------

Searching is case **insensitive** and allows mixing of case. In the
examples below, the exact same results would be returned regardless of
the capitalization.

Search examples: 
```create a common framework```, ```Create a Common Framework```, ```cReatE A CoMmoN FraMewoRk```

### 2.1.6 Filtered Searches
------

From the search results screen the left-most panel is the Filters panel.  
Here, results can be narrowed by filtering on various aspects such as:
 
 * **Name:**  The name of the entry
 
 * **Tag:**  Type the name of a tag or select from the drop-down.  Tags can be combined and 
          added to the filter or removed.
 
 * **Topic:**  DI2E Component, Article, etc.
 
 * **User Rating:**  This will show all entries with the average star rating selected 
                 (or better, i.e. or a **higher** average star rating)
 
 * **Vitals:**  This gives a fine-tuned and very detailed approach to filtering by many different 
            vitals such as DI2E Intent, State, and Alignment, for example.
 
 


### 2.1.7 Tags  
------

Users can "Tag" listings so that they can be used to later find and
refine search results. User-created tags are visible to all users.
However, only the owner of the tag or an admin user may remove a tag.
Tags are used in the search field shown at the top of the screen and 
on the home page.

**How to create a tag:**

 1.  From the search results screen, click on the entry title.  The details of the 
	 entry will be displayed.
 2.  Click on the "Tag" icon to open the tag panel.
 3.  Enter a new tag in the text field OR choose an existing tag by clicking on 
	 the drop down arrow.  Click "Add" to apply the tag to the entry.

**How to remove a tag you created:**

 1.  From the search results screen, click on the entry title.  The details of the 
	 entry will be displayed.
 2.  Click on the "Tag" icon to open the tag panel.  Tags will be displayed
	 below the "Add Tag" text field.
 3.  Locate the tag and click on the drop down arrow and select "Remove".

### 2.1.8 Comparing
---------

The comparison feature allows for side-by-side viewing of multiple
listings. For example, there may be several entries that provide the
same kind of features (e.g. Cesium and Google maps). You can use the
comparison feature to view their details together to find the entry
better suited your project's needs.

**How to compare entries:**

 1.  From the Search Results screen check the "Add to Compare" box on 2 or more 
	 entries.
 2.  Click on the **Compare** button at the top of the Search Results window.  A
	 side-by-side comparison will appear in a new window.
 3.  If more than two entries were selected, you can select which entries to compare
	 by using the drop-down list at the top to select the various entries.
 4.  To remove all selected entries,  click on the drop-down arrow next to the
	 **Compare** button and select "Clear All Selected Entries".

### 2.1.9 Customizing the Search Display
---------

On the search results page, filtering can be done by Name, Tag, Topic, User Rating, or Vitals.
To search by Topic you can use the drop-down menu or click on the hyperlink at the top
with the number of results, for example:
**[131]()** DI2E Components, **[21]()** Articles where the numbers are hyperlinks
that filter the results.

The search results display can also be customized by clicking on the gear icon
and down arrow at the top-right of the search results.  Check or uncheck the 
items to be displayed or hidden such as:

* Organization

* Badges

* Description

* Last Update

* Vitals

* Tags

* Average User Rating

* Approved Date

* Index Relevance

To reset all filters, click on the "Reset Filters" button at the bottom of the
Filters column.

------------

The user can create watches that can send notifications to the user. The
messages that the watches generate are viewable from the User Message
Tool. The User Message Tool allows for queued messages to be processed
after a delayed time period. The queue delay allows for messages to be
pooled by type thereby reducing the amount of emails rapid changes can
create. The User Message can also be used to view previously sent
messages in cases of troubleshooting whether the system sent a
notification or not. The tools also allow for manually processing the
queue immediately, but in most cases this is not needed or desired as
the automatic process will take handling the message queue.

A watch is set on a entry to allow for a user to be notified of
changes to an entry. There are two ways notifications occur in the
application, and there is no limit to the amount of watches a user may
place.

1.  The watched entry's changes are visually shown to the user
    anytime changes have been made since they last viewed the entry.
    This is seen in the watches tab and when viewing the details of
    an entry.

2.  The user may opt to have an email sent anytime there is a change. To
    opt in, see the steps listed below. The email will list the section
    of the entry information as to what has changed. A user then can
    login to view the exact changes.

**To activate email:**

1.  Make sure your user profile contains a valid email. View your
    profile from the Profile button at the top of the screen in User Tools.

2.  Select a watch from User Tools, Tools, Watches.  Click the Toggle 
    Email Notification button to turn on or turn off the email notifications.

**See the Section 2.4 for information on how to add or remove an entry to watch list.**

represent a single attribute of a listing (E.g. "Funded" would be a type
with the corresponding value "Yes" or "No"). A type may have many codes.  

Deleting a type will delete the associated codes and entry
attributes. Inactivating a type will inactivate associated data such as
entry attributes.

**NOTE**: Avoid "/" and special characters in type codes. For example,
use: \[A-Z\]\[0-9\].

**To add or edit a type:**

From the Attribute Tool, click on the **Add New Type** button or the
    **Edit Attribute** button.

**FIELDS include:** 

 1. Label:  The name of the Attribute
 2. Type Code:  The unique code, should be ALL-CAPS and should not contain spaces or "/". 
 3. Detailed Description:  The description of the attribute.  It can contain formatted (rich) text.
 4. Associated Entry Types:  Allow this attribute on all types or only certain types (Articles, Entries, etc.)
 5. Flags:  Set the flags shown on the main page for Required, Visible, Important, Architecture, Allow Multiple,
     Allow User-Created Codes, or Hide on Submission.

(media, user reviews, questions, etc.)

1.  Click the delete icon to remove.

2.  Confirm that you want to delete the entry by clicking **OK** on
    the confirmation dialog.

**To export an entry:**

1.  Select one or more entries you want exported.

2.  Click the **Export** button in the toolbar.

 Components are exported as zip files containing a JSON array of the
 entry data, media and local resources associated with the selected
 entries.

**To import an entry:**

1.  Select a file (zip or JSON text file).

2.  Select import options (i.e. the user data you want to import).

3.  Click **Upload**. The processing will happen in the background and a
    new task will be created to handle the import. The application will
    notify the admin when the task is complete or if there was an issue.


#### 3.2.3.2 Approval @ADMIN-ENTRY-MANAGEMENT
------

Approved entries are searchable by all users. Pending/Not submitted entries
are viewable only by an admin. An admin can approve a "Not Submitted" entry but 
be aware that the entry may have only been partially completed by the user.  
The approval date is considered to be the "Recently Added" date for the Recently Added list
on the home page.

**To approve an entry:**

1.  Click on an entry with a status of Pending/Not Submitted.
2.  If you would like to preview the entry, click on the **View** button in the toolbar.  Close the **Preview** window
	after viewing entry.
3.  Click on the **Approve** button in the toolbar.  The status should now reflect the approval.
 

**NOTE:** An admin can mark an entry as **Pending** by following the
step above and selecting **Pending**. Marking the entry as 
**Pending** makes it not approved.


#### 3.2.3.3 General @ADMIN-ENTRY-MANAGEMENT
------

General information about the entry is found here such as the Name, 
Description, Organization, etc.

**To edit General fields:**

1.  Navigate to the Component Tool.

2.  Click on the **Edit** icon on the entry.

3.  Click the **General** tab.

**Other Fields**

a. Approval State:  Pending | Approved | Not Submitted

c. Security Type:   *select the security level of the entry or article*

From the **Action** drop-down menu in the toolbar, an administrator can change the ownership or
type of an entry.  He/she can also view change requests and merge entries together.
  
### 3.2.4 Entry Types @ADMIN-ENTRY-TYPES
------

Currently, the main entry types are: Article, DI2E Component, and DI2E Document.  However, other custom 
types can be added, edited, activated, made inactive, and removed here.  

On the Add form, data entry can be selected, such as whether or not to allow on the 
submission form, and to allow or not allow the following to be displayed:

*Attributes, Relationships, Contacts, Resources, Media, Dependencies, Metadata,
Evaluation Information, Reviews, and Questions.*

Entry Types can be made active or inactive by using the Toggle Status button.

**Note:** Making an entry type Inactive does **not** remove that entry type from existing
          entries; it simply prevents that entry type from being added in future entry 
          submissions.

New with v2.1 Entry Types can now be **removed**.  When you remove a type the system will ask 
 what remaining active entry type you would like to move the existing data to.   This ensures that 
 data (entries) are not lost, but moved to a remaining, active entry type.

**Note:** It is recommended to toggle the status of a type to **inactive**, rather than remove it.  
          Removing entry type that has attribute restriction can change the behavior of the require
          attributes. It may only be required for entries of type A but when type A is removed then
          the attribute will be required for all entries. 
          (It will require an admin to manually update the attributed if that is not the correct behavior).
  
		  
		  
### 3.2.5 Entry Templates @ADMIN-ENTRY-TEMPLATES

on either the **Up** or **Down** button in the toolbar.

### 3.2.7 Integrations @ADMIN-INTEGRATION
-------

Component Integration allows for pulling information from an external
system and mapping that back to an entry in the application. This
allows for automatic sync of the data source. Currently, the application
only supports integration with Jira.

**To setup a Jira Integration:**

1.  Navigate to Integration Management Admin Tool using the admin
    navigation menu.

**Add Mappings:**

1.  Select Jira Project.
2.  Select Issue Type.
3.  Select Attribute in application.
4.  Select Jira field to which to map.
5.  Create mapping by moving them from the available list to
        attribute codes.
6.  Click **Save**.

 **NOTE:** More than one field in JIRA can be mapped to an attribute
        code.

**Add Configuration:**

1.  Create a new Configuration by clicking **Add** on the Component
    Configuration tab.
2.  Select a Component.
3.  Click **Add**.
4.  Select JIRA Project (only projects with mappings will be available).
5.  Enter the Jira Issue Number (Eg. ASSET-14).
6.  Click **Save**.

The Component Job will be scheduled when it is saved. The job will run on
an interval based on the global refresh rate. The default is once a day
at 10:00 am server time. The entry configuration table will show
when the integration last ran. Also, the scheduled integration job can
be viewed using the Jobs Tool by clicking **Show Integration Jobs**.

The Integration Tool allows for manual control; however, it is not
necessary to run the integration manually as the automated job will
handle that.

If the integration fails for any reason, the configuration table will
indicate that a failure occurred and an error ticket will be created for further 
analysis. The integration may fail if the server it is connecting to is unavailable.
This may be a temporary condition. The system will try again on the next
interval. If the configuration job continues to have issues, it may be
deactivated manually using the tools and then reactivated when the issue
is resolved.

### 3.2.8 Imports @ADMIN-DATA-IMPORT-EXPORT
-------

This allows for data imports and mappings.  This is done by importing a file.
Various file formats can be imported such as .csv, .xlsx, JSON, .tsv, .xml, and .zip.  
Once imported warnings and/or errors can be viewed, the data can be reprocessed 
or rolled back.

Data mapping allows for a custom data file format to be established for importing data.
Once a file is uploaded individual fields can be mapped.  Then a data file can be
imported using that mapping.

**NOTE:**  The import history is only kept for **180 days (Default)**.

#### 3.2.8.1 Data Mapping @ADMIN-DATA-IMPORT-EXPORT

Some data importing can be handled by creating data maps.  Typically file with
simple structure work best.  In some cases, a custom file parse will need to be 
created.  Custom parsers require coding and then they can be added to the application
via the plugin feature.

Built-in Supported Mappable Format:

Parser - Record Structure handled

**Attribute CSV, Attribute EXCEL (XLSX), Attribute TSV**  

- Record (Attribute Code) per line
- Header line not support (Remove before upload)
- Does not support attachments
- Map Name is used for Attribute Type

**Attribute JSON, Attribute XML**

- Support Nested structure, still assumes file contain Attribute Codes to map;
	
**Component CSV, Component EXCEL (XLSX), Component TSV**	

- Record (Component) per line;  It can map SubComponent Entities as well.
- Header line not support (Remove before upload)
- Does not support attachments (Local resources or media)

**Component JSON, Component XML**	

- Nested record (Component/Contact/etc)
- Does not support attachments (Local resources or media)

**Creating a data map**

**Attribute**

* Map Fields for (Attribute Type and Attribute Codes)

**Component/Entry**

* Map Fields for Component, Contacts, Resource, etc

* Provide attribute mapping for each attribute type expected.


### 3.2.9 Lookups @ADMIN-LOOKUPS
--------

#### 3.2.15.5 User Profiles @ADMIN-USER-MANAGEMENT
------

Every user in the system has a user profile.  A user profile contains information
about the user and their user specific settings.   The initial creation of the profile
at first login will contain the information gathered from the external security application.

The application does not directly manage users, only profiles. When a user
first securely logs in, a profile is created. It is up to the applicable
security utility (Open AM, LDAP, Databaseetc.) to define the users.

An admin may edit, activate, or deactivate a profile. Deactivating a
profile does not prevent login. Upon login, the user's profile will be
reactivated. Once a profile has been deactivated, that user's watches
and messages are also deactivated. Reactivating the profile will
activate the user's existing watches, but it won't send any previous
messages  just messages going forward.

**To toggle active status:**

1.  Under *Manage User Profiles*, select the profile whose status you would like to change

2.  Click on **Toggle Status**

Users can message other users using User Profiles. The message will be sent to the email address listed in their profile.

**To message a user or a group of users:**

1.  Click on the message icon next to the user (or users) that you want to message.

2.  Fill out the form.

3.  Click **Send** to send the message immediately.

addresses are leaked to other users.

**To Export user data:**

1.  Select the users desired for the export.

2.  Click on Export above and to the right of the table.

3.  Save the .json file locally.  The file contains the user information.

completes. Scheduled jobs that run periodically, such as the notification
job, also run in the background to provide automatic handling of
services.
