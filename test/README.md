Sample and Test Database
============

A Sample and Test Database is included here to:

 - Provide a sample database new users can install to get a feel for the Storefront website.  The database contains a 
   familiar organization of music including 14 artists and 105 albums.  By browsing the information the user will get
   a feel for how the Storefront is organized and displayed, without having to worry about technical entries.
   
 - Establish a static test database for automated regression testing.  The database can be imported and used for unit
     and integration automated testing.  Queries for certain known entries with known search results, for example, can
     be established.
     
 - **NOTE:** The data contained in the sample database is used with permission from http://musicbrainz.org
